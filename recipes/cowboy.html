    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><h3>This cowboy mashed potato casserole, a smoky beef and veggie mixture topped with creamy mashed potatoes, is like a cowboy version of a shepherds pie. The crispy bacon and French fried onions on top add crunch and flavor.</h3></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>6 strips of bacon</li>
        <li>2 pounds baking potatos, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>5 ounce can evaporated or whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen whole kernel corn</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 cup barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup canned french fried onions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray. Place baking dish on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Place bacon on a paper towel to drain. Drain all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat in the skillet. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and return to a boil. Cook, covered, until potatoes are fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes. Return potatoes back to the pot along with evaporated milk, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Mash potatoes with a potato masher until smooth. Stir 1/4 cup chopped bacon into mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef, onion, and bell pepper to the skillet with reserved bacon fat. Cook over medium heat until meat is browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add corn kernels, garlic, and paprika to the skillet. Cook and stir for 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Stir in barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread ground beef mixture in prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread potatoes evenly over beef. Sprinkle with cheese, remaining bacon, and French fried onions.</li>
        <li>Bake until meat mixture is bubbly and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
